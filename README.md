# Discord Invite Formatter
##How To Use
- put all your unformatted invites in "invites.txt" eg. discord.gg/12345 - Name: poaeirhgpoierhg/rh56/dfg/5i
- lets say you got hella dupes in that file aswell, this tool removes those and anything after the actual invite
- thats it this tool is super easy to use

if you really stuck my discord's on my github profile
